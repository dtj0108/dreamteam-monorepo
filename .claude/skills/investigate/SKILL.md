# Investigation Skill

Before proposing any fix:
1. Trace the data flow from source to symptom
2. Identify all code paths that touch the affected data
3. List potential root causes with evidence
4. Ask user to confirm the root cause before implementing

Do NOT implement fixes until root cause is confirmed.
