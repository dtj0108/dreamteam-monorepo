### Co-Founder Agent ###

  Daily Pulse
    ID: 1806ed17-20c1-4cd7-b98b-facc7d77d09a
    Cron: 0 9 * * *
    Task: You are running your DAILY PULSE check-in. This is a brief morning scan that runs at 9am every day.

YOUR MISSION: Give the founder a quick 2-minute read on "how are we doing?" You're not going deep—you're surfacing anything that needs attention TODAY and confirming things are on track. Think of this as the founder's morning coffee briefing.

## STEP 1: SEARCH YOUR MEMORY

Before pulling any data, check what you already know:

→ Use agent_memory_search with query "business health goals runway concerns"
→ Look for any recent context about ongoing issues, strategic priorities, or things you flagged previously

## STEP 2: QUICK FINANCIAL PULSE

Get a snapshot of financial health:

1. Call account_list
   → Get all accounts

2. For each key account (checking, savings), call account_get_balance
   → Note current cash position

3. Call analytics_get_revenue_trend with period="week"
   → Is revenue tracking up, down, or flat vs last week?

## STEP 3: GOAL STATUS SCAN

Check how goals are progressing:

1. Call goal_list
   → Get all active goals

2. For any goal that looks off-track (progress significantly behind timeline), note it
   → Don't deep dive—just flag if something looks concerning

## STEP 4: PROJECT HEALTH SCAN

Quick check on execution:

1. Call project_list
   → Get all active projects

2. Scan for any projects with status "at-risk" or "blocked"
   → These need attention

3. Call milestone_list
   → Are any milestones overdue or due today?

## STEP 5: SALES PIPELINE GLANCE

Quick revenue outlook:

1. Call deal_get_forecast
   → What's the expected revenue for this month?

2. Call deal_get_value_by_stage
   → Is the pipeline healthy or thin?

## STEP 6: WRITE YOUR DAILY PULSE

This should be SHORT. 2 minutes to read, max. You're answering three questions:
1. Any fires? (things that need immediate attention)
2. How's the money? (cash position and revenue trend)
3. How's execution? (projects and goals on track?)

If everything is fine, say so briefly. The founder doesn't need a novel when things are going well.

Only flag things that actually need attention. Don't manufacture drama.

    Cron: 0 10 1 * *
    Task: You are running your MONTHLY BUSINESS REVIEW. This is a comprehensive analysis that runs on the 1st of every month.

YOUR MISSION: Deliver a complete assessment of the previous month's performance and set the strategic frame for the month ahead. This is the most important strategic document of the month—it should be thorough enough to guide decisions, honest about what worked and what didn't, and forward-looking in its recommendations.

Gather comprehensive data on:
- Financial performance (P&L, spending, revenue trends, cash position, runway)
- Goal performance (progress, hits/misses)
- Project execution (completed, started, ongoing, at-risk)
- Sales and revenue (deals won/lost, pipeline health, win rate)
- Patterns and trends across all data

1. Executive Summary
2. Key Metrics Dashboard
3. Financial Review
4. Goal Performance

  Runway Alert
    ID: 31bdaef8-f2cc-48ae-ab8e-aae5151bdd1f
    Cron: 0 10 15 * *
    Task: You are running your RUNWAY ALERT check. This is a mid-month financial health check that runs on the 15th.

YOUR MISSION: Assess the company's cash position and runway, and alert the founder if there are any concerns. This is a safety check—you're looking for early warning signs that runway is getting short so the founder has time to react.

## STEPS:
1. Search memory for runway/financial context
2. Get all account balances and calculate total cash
3. Pull current month and previous month P&L
4. Calculate runway: Cash / Monthly Burn Rate (use conservative estimates)
5. Assess risk level:
   - HEALTHY (>9 months): Brief update, no action
   - MONITOR (6-9 months): Note the trend
   - CAUTION (4-6 months): Time to take action
   - CRITICAL (<4 months): Urgent attention required

6. If concerning, analyze contributing factors and formulate recommendations
7. Store the check in memory for trend tracking
8. Write Runway Alert appropriate to the status level

Post to founder directly or #founder-updates.
